Let's start focusing on the first and the most important feature for Figma --- Design!

Before we design an interface, we will need to set the screen size, is it a design for desktop? Mobile phone? Or tablet?

In order to do this, we can use the **frame** tool.

![navbar_left](./Tutorial/navbar_left.jpg)

Click the # button (third one from the left)

![Frame types](./Tutorial/frame.jpg)

You can see there are different type of frames that you can use! (You can even use figma to design for your social media post!)

We will choose **iPhone 8** frame for now, click the Phone accordion and click iPhone 8.

![iphone_8](./Tutorial/iphone_8.jpg)

Now, you have successfully created a frame! Congrats üéâ! Take a coffee break!

If I still have your attention, we can continue to the next step!
